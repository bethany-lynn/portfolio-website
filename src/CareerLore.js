      <h1 className='card-title' >How I Got Here</h1>
      <div className="card-content">
        At the age of 17, I went to beauty school, and immediately knew I wanted
        to work for myself, or away from the grind-culture of the beauty industry.
        <br />
        I worked very hard for half a dozen years to build my own business,
        community, and brand for myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        While I loved many aspects of my career, especially the creative side and the freedom to
        create my own schedule,
        <br />
        I struggled to find work-life balance. My home life is important to me, and when the pandemic
        lockdown hit, all of my struggles and goals came to a head.
        <br />
        I was out of work, like many, for months. Coming back into my salon, it was a struggle to pick up
        the pace and same income because so many things had shifted.
        <br />
        So I took a big chance after 13 years doing hair, moved to California from Illinois, and decided
        to start teaching myself how to code before joining a bootcamp!
        <br />
        <br />
        I loved the idea of working remotely, especially as an introvert, and the endless possibilities
        that come with working in tech. Job assurance is essentially built-in.
        <br />
        I enjoy coding, and I really enjoy the idea of using my skills and knowledge to create my actual dream
        life: relaxing with my dog and visiting friends and family across the county.
        <br />

        <h1 className='card-title'>My Aspirations and Values</h1>
        I want to work for a company that sees technology as a tool to improve daily life. That can look 
        like a lot of different things, but progress should exist
        <br />
        to make life easier and more enriching for us all. Professional relationships are important and valuable,
        <br />
        but to me, we should use work as a jumping point to really invest in our personal lives and what brings us joy.
        <br />
        <br />
        For some people, that is work. For me, that looks like a lot of time enjoying a cup of tea in nature, with my dog,
        <br /> 
        maybe by a bonfire, and seeing all corners of the world.
        <br />
        Community, inclusivity, kindness, and the earth are my biggest passions, and I'd love to work
        with people who felt similarly.

      <div className="card-content">
        <h1 className='card-title'>Free Time</h1>
        In my free time, I do drink a hefty amount of tea, and I'm usually drinking it while playing a video game,
        doing a puzzle,
        <br />
        reading a book, or watching anime. Since most of my hobbies are sedentary, I try to get outside
        <br /> 
        with my pup, Satoru, a few times a day, and out to our local park a couple times a week.
        We both enjoy the sound and sight of birds and water.
