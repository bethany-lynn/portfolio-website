        <div className="card-content">
          At the age of 17, I went to beauty school, and
          immediately knew I wanted to work for myself, or away from the grind-culture of the beauty industry.
          I worked very hard for half a dozen years to build my own business,
          community, and brand for myself.
          While I loved many aspects of my career, especially the creative side and the freedom to
          create my own schedule,
          I struggled to find work-life balance. My home life is important to me,
          and when the pandemic lockdown hit, all of my struggles and goals came to a head.
          I was out of work, like many, for months. Coming back into my salon, it was a struggle to pick up
          the pace and same income because so many things had shifted.
          So I took a big chance after 13 years doing hair, moved to California from Illinois, and decided
          to start teaching myself how to code before joining a bootcamp!
          I loved the idea of working remotely, especially as an introvert, and the endless possibilities
          that come with working in tech. Job assurance is essentially built-in.
          I enjoy coding, and I really enjoy the idea of using my skills and knowledge to create my actual dream
          life: relaxing with my dog and visiting friends and family across the county.

        <h1 className='card-title'>My Aspirations and Values</h1>
        <div className="card-content">
          I want to work for a company that sees technology as a tool to improve daily life.
          That can look like a lot of different things, but progress should exist
          to make life easier and more enriching for us all. Professional relationships are important and valuable,
          but to me, we should use work as a jumping point to really invest in our personal lives and what brings us joy.
          For some people, that is work. For me, that looks like a lot of time enjoying a cup of tea in nature, with my dog,
          maybe by a bonfire, and seeing all corners of the world.
          Community, inclusivity, kindness, and the earth are my biggest passions, and I'd love to work
          with people who felt similarly.

        <h1 className='card-title'>Free Time</h1>
        <div className="card-content">
          In my free time, I do drink a hefty amount of tea, and I'm usually drinking it while playing a video game,
          doing a puzzle, reading a book, or watching anime. Since most of my hobbies are sedentary, I try to get outside
          with my pup, Satoru, and my partner, Max, a few times a day, and out to our local park a couple times a week.
          We both enjoy the sound and sight of birds and water. We hope to one day invest in an RV, remodel it, and use it to
          drive all over the country, and visit every forest we can!
